<h2> Michael Lynch </h2>
<h3>Name</h3>
I like my name, but it is absurdly common. Not only am I the fourth Michael Lynch in a row (although not Michael the Fourth, since my middle name is different), I am one of nearly *5 million people* in the United States named Michael. That's more people than the **entire state** of Alabama.

<h3>Geography</h3>
I was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and lived there until I was four, when my family moved to Georgia so my dad could work for the Centers for Disease Control. I grew up in Dunwoody, Georgia, a suburb north of Atlanta. There's not much there other than some trees and hills, but Ryan Seacrest went to my high school. So that's fun.

<h3>School</h3>
I'm doing a Joint BA/MA here at UChicago, in Economics and International Relations. This class counts towards the latter. 

<h3>Interests</h3>
In my free time, I enjoy reading, mostly the news, which makes me sad, and fantasy, which doesn't (usually).
